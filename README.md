# Portfolio Prep

I retired 2 years ago from the US Army and since then have been a project manager for a construction testing and inspection company.  I am a software developer because I enjoy problem-solving.  I specifically chose this field because it allows me to learn new things, always presents a challenge, and I’ll be able to grow professionally.  I’m hoping to find a role in an environment where I can work with a small team and see projects from start to finish.  I have a lot of soft-skills leaders need to be effective; gained from years of managing and training increasingly larger groups.

- Integrity
- Adaptability
- Communication
- Empathy
- Decision making

There are two major things that excite me about tech, first is that the field is constantly growing and adapting which creates a lot of opportunity for me both professionally and personally.  Second is a love / hate in that there is always a problem to be fixed; I will finish projects but there will always be something more to do if I want.
